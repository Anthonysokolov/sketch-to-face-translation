# sketch-to-face-translation
This repository features several notebooks exploring the performance of different GAN architectures in the task of translating an outline image of a face into a realistic image of a human face. 

# Milestones
Test the performance of different generator network depths and Adam optimizer learning rates on a conditional GAN model.  
Test the performance of different optimization algorithms and learning rates on a CycleGAN model.  
Clean dataset for centered, non distorted images.  

# Dataset
Facial images taken from `https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset`.  
Facial outlines generated using Canny Edge Detection algorithm.  
Realistic sketches generated using openCV.
